\velkynadpis{Sum Pyramid}

You will receive a number $n$ ($1\leq n \leq 20$) and $n$ numbers on the input. Your task is to create a sum pyramid from the array on the input. You will always add two numbers in the array that are next to each other and print their sum. You will continue like this until only one number remains.

You can assume that all numbers on the input are less than $20$, and that all intermediate results fit into a standard \texttt{int}. Place \textbf{exactly} one space between each pair of numbers on the same line, do not put a space at the end of the line, but terminate it with a newline. Take inspiration from the sample input and output.
