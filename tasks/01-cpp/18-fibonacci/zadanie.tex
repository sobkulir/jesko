\velkynadpis{Fibonacci}

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers starting with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The first terms of the Fibonacci sequence look like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

You will receive one number $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 30$) on the input. Your task is to print the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers.

\textbf{Note:} Pay attention to formatting. There should be a newline (\verb!'\n'!) after the last number in the output, not a space.
